👋 Hi there! I'm Anne, a budding data enthusiast exploring the beauty of data structures and diving into the exhilarating field of deep learning.

🔭 I’m currently learning all the basic about the essence of computer science while working on some personal or group projects, including:
- Creating an interative web application with **Neural Style Transfer** using TensorFlow
- Developing a **Handwritten Digit Classifier** with PyTorch
- **Landmark Classification & Tagging** for social media
- **Text Translation and Sentiment Analysis** using Transformers
- **Face Generation** models

🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced deep learning techniques and building the foundational bricks of my knowledge.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects in software, web development, and AI, especially those involving computer vision and natural language processing!

🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding complex neural network architectures and best practices for deep learning.

💬 Ask me about my projects.

📫 How to reach me:  
- LinkedIn: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyen-quynh-anh-pham-7454a5234/)  
- Email: phamn@dickinson.edu

😄 Pronouns: She/Her

⚡ Fun fact: I love listening to Ludovico Einaudi and Hans Zimmer while studying, Fairy Tail is my childhood show since I kinda sticked with animes for a while, and I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's movies!
