ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Anne, a budding data enthusiast exploring the beauty of data structures and diving into the exhilarating field of deep learning.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning all the basic about the essence of computer science while working on some personal or group projects, including:
- Creating an interative web application with **Neural Style Transfer** using TensorFlow
- Developing a **Handwritten Digit Classifier** with PyTorch
- **Landmark Classification & Tagging** for social media
- **Text Translation and Sentiment Analysis** using Transformers
- **Face Generation** models

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about advanced deep learning techniques and building the foundational bricks of my knowledge.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative projects in software, web development, and AI, especially those involving computer vision and natural language processing!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding complex neural network architectures and best practices for deep learning.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to Ludovico Einaudi and Hans Zimmer while studying, Fairy Tail is my childhood show since I kinda sticked up with animes for a while, and I'm a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's movies!
